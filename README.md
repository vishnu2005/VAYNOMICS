**VAYNOMICS** is a smart fare comparison web application that estimates ride fares across various transport modes—Uber, Rapido (bike/car), Metro, Bus, and even your own vehicle—based on source and destination. It combines real-time geospatial routing, machine learning, and transit fare logic to provide commuters with the most cost-effective travel options.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧠 **Uber Fare Prediction via ML Model (Random Forest Regressor)**  
  Trained on a synthetic but realistic Indian Uber dataset using pickup/dropoff coordinates, time of day, ride type, and city.

- 🛵 **Rapido Fare Estimation (Car/Bike)**  
  Surge-adjusted heuristic formulas for both ride types.

- 🚌 **Metro & Bus Fare Logic (Chennai & Bengaluru)**  
  Real routes, durations, and fare stages implemented with database-backed lookups.

- ✅ **Smart City-Aware System**  
  Understands whether to apply Chennai or Bengaluru metro/bus fare logic dynamically based on location.

- ⛽ **Fuel Cost Estimator**  
  Calculates personal vehicle fuel cost using user-provided mileage and fuel price.

- 🗺️ **OpenRouteService Integration**  
  Accurate geocoding, route distance, and duration between source and destination.

- 📊 **Charts & Tables**  
  Beautiful D3.js charts and tables to compare fares & durations visually.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User inputs**: Source, Destination, Mileage, Fuel Price
2. **ORS API**: Gets route distance/duration from OpenRouteService
3. **City Detection**: Determines if metro/bus available
4. **Fare Calculations**:
   - Uber (Go/Auto/XL) → ML model prediction
   - Rapido (bike/car) → Heuristic formula
   - Metro/Bus → MongoDB lookup (real data)
   - Own Vehicle → Based on mileage & fuel price
5. **Response**: Sorted fare table + duration chart sent back to frontend

## 🧪 Example Input

Source: T Nagar, Chennai
Destination: Koyambedu, Chennai
Mileage: 20 km/l
Fuel Price: ₹110/litre

## 🧠 ML Model Details

- Model: RandomForestRegressor
- Inputs: pickup/dropoff lat/lng, hour, weekday, peak hour, ride type
- Outputs: Predicted base fare → returns a range [min, max] with surge consideration
- Dataset: Custom synthetic Uber India dataset
- Accuracy: R² ≈ 0.96+ on validation set

---

## 📊 Real-World Fare Prediction Accuracy
VAYNOMICS goes beyond theoretical accuracy — it provides transparent dashboards to showcase how well its fare predictions align with real-world data across Indian cities.
To showcase transparency and reliability, VAYNOMICS includes **accuracy dashboards** for both its ML-driven and heuristic estimators.

### 🚖 Uber Fare Prediction – ML Model (Random Forest Regressor)

📈 **Metric**: Accuracy % vs. route-based real fares  
📍 **Test Cases**: Popular routes like T Nagar → Koyambedu, Koramangala → Majestic, etc.  
🧠 **Model**: Trained on a custom Uber-style Indian dataset using city, ride type, and time-based features  
✅ **Observed Accuracy**: ~91% average accuracy across major city routes (Uber Go, Auto, XL)  
📌 Even without real-time *paid* Uber API access, the model reliably mimics realistic fare trends and behavior.

### 🛵 Rapido Fare Estimator – Surge-Adjusted Heuristic

📈 **Metric**: Accuracy % vs. observed fare samples  
🧪 **Evaluation**: Real Rapido fares benchmarked in Chennai & Bengaluru (Bike and Car)  
⚙️ **Logic**: Time-based surge multipliers + city-wise base rates  
✅ **Observed Accuracy**: ~92–94% accuracy across various locations and time slots  
📌 Tuned using real fare benchmarks to closely simulate Rapido's dynamic pricing.

## ⚠️ Why No Model Can Perfectly Predict Uber Fares

Uber’s fare system is driven by a **highly dynamic and proprietary surge algorithm**, which includes variables that are:

- 🔁 Continuously changing in real time  
- 📍 Hyper-local (specific to exact pickup/drop points)  
- 🧠 Internally weighted and inaccessible to public APIs

### Key factors influencing Uber's volatile pricing:

- 🚦 Live traffic congestion  
- 🕒 Time-of-day sensitivity (rush hours vs off-peak)  
- 🌧️ Weather fluctuations  
- 📊 Rider vs driver supply-demand imbalance  
- 🧬 Non-linear surge multiplier logic

> 💡 **Conclusion**: No ML model or heuristic formula — no matter how well trained — can fully capture this volatility.

---

## 📉 Fare Volatility: Real-World Visual Proof

To validate this, **VAYNOMICS** includes a **custom line graph** illustrating how **Uber fares fluctuate dramatically for the *same source and destination*** depending on the time, day, and environmental context.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/uber_fare_volatility_chart.png" alt="Uber Fare Volatility Graph" width="850"/>
  <br/><em>Fare fluctuation for the same route (Meenambakkam → Guindy) over multiple times & days</em>
</p>

📊 This visualization clearly shows:

- 🔺 Peak-hour prices can double compared to non-peak  
- 🌀 There's no consistent pattern across days  
- 🔍 Any fixed prediction will likely be misleading or outdated

---

## ✅ VAYNOMICS: Honest, Transparent, and Practical

Instead of overpromising with fixed fare outputs, **VAYNOMICS embraces transparency** by showing a **realistic fare range** (`min – max`) that adapts to time and location context.

This choice was made **deliberately** to:

- Reflect how real users experience Uber fares  
- Prevent misleading “exact” estimates  
- Prioritize practical usability over theoretical perfection

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Despite not using paid APIs or Uber’s internal pricing logic, this project was built from the ground up to **mirror real-world behavior as closely as possible**:

- 🔬 I trained a machine learning model tailored to Indian city rides  
- 🔁 Benchmarked and tuned formulas using actual field data  
- 📉 Built time-series dashboards to prove model limitations  
- 🌐 Developed full-stack integrations for a seamless user experience

> ✨ **VAYNOMICS isn't about perfect predictions — it's about intelligent, transparent, and user-focused insights.**  
It’s proof that thoughtful design and engineering **can solve complex problems with limited resources.**
